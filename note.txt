    1.Q: when there a few news(for example, you have crawled news, and then you restart this program within minutes), you will find that your program are blocking somewhere. But
         when there a lot of news this bug will not happen.
    2.S: I put some debug sentence near some possible wrong codes, finally I found that queue block cause this bug.
         When the only one element(for example, there is just one) is got by some thread, the queue is empty. If the block para is not be setted,
         the other threads are all waiting to get element from queue.
